	<p>Hello.</p>
	<p>I'm a digital guy at <a href="http://registerguard.com" target="_blank">The Register-Guard</a>. My job includes a lot of web development and maintenance.</p>
	<p>Sometimes that means trying to pare down technical debt, sometimes that means making new things. I use a variety of languages, from the proprietary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterSystems_Cach%C3%A9" target="_blank">InterSystems Cach√©</a> to Python, and a ton of HTML/CSS/JS.</p>
	<p>At various other points in the day I may do data analysis, analytics reporting, social media management or photo editing.</p>
	<p>Here are some fun facts about me:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I believe that alternative forms of storytelling can help build deeper reader engagement. Sometimes that means collaborating with different department and sometimes that means digging through data.</li>
		<li>I believe that being a life-long learner is something we should all strive for.</li>
		<li>I going on adventures, away from technology, can make you a better developer. Going on hikes and long bike rides can help reset your mind and think of new ways to tackle coding problems.</li>
		<li>I believe that strong student media is the single most important thing to the news industry. High school and college newsrooms should serve as incubators for new ideas and business models.</li>
	</ul>
