	<p>I've been fortunate to do a lot of different things in journalism, working in small-town newsrooms and national bureaus. Here's a few examples of things that I've done in the past.</p>

	<h2>Story production</h2>

	<p>While working at The Register-Guard I've been able to work with reporters and photographers in producing some special online presentations. Here are a few.</p>

			<div class="owl-caption">Reporter Christian Hill deconstructs the heartbreaking Eugene police response that ended in the death of a wounded veteran with PTSD. I had a mountain of interviews, crime scene images, video and copy to try and piece together an engaging online experience that stepped the reader through the hour. <a href="http://cloud.registerguard.com/brian-babbs-final-hour/">Read the story.</a></div>

The initial story was created the day after the fire and added to over time. <a href="http://pages.registerguard.com/springfield-plywood-and-veneer-mill-fire/">Read the story.</a></div>

	<h2>Photos</h2>

	<p>I first got into journalism via photography. Since those early yearbook days, I've been able to shoot for several organizations. Here's a sampling of that work.</p>

    <h2>Bits and bytes</h2>

    <p>I've pieced together a few things for The Register-Guard</p>

    <ul>
    	<li><a href="https://github.com/registerguard/TweetTweet">TweetTweet</a> - A Python script that reads an RSS feed, checks for new content and tweets out anything it finds with a custom bit.ly short link.</li>
    	<li><a href="https://github.com/registerguard/ssp-api">ssp api</a> - A means of outputting a JSON api from the now defunct Slideshow Pro so that you don't need to use their Flash-based viewer.</li>
    	<li>I've also worked on <a href="http://tarbell.io">Tarbell</a>, <a href="http://djangoproject.com">Django</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterSystems_Cach%C3%A9">InterSystems Cach√©</a> projects but those repos are private.</li>
    	<!-- <li>When I first started I was able to get some basic newsroom tech skills into a Jekyll blog at <a href="http://newsroom.registerguard.com/">newsroom.registerguard.com</a>, but that has been put on the back burner for some time.</li> -->
    </ul>

    <h2>Video</h2>

    <p>While at the University of Colorado - Boulder I invested a lot of time into  student media and as Editor-in-Chief I produced this marketing video for the organization.</p>
